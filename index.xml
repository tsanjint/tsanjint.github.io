      <description>Why I start this blog? ðŸ”—How to make $10,000 a month is not what this blog is about. School never taught us much about managing our money, doing our taxes or planning for financial freedom.
Through this blog, I want to share with you what I have learnt about personal finance, budgeting for family, insurance policy to protect you and your family, saving for taxes, investing for beginners, estate planning and achieving financial freedom.</description>
